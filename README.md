## Requirements

You have been asked to design a system for handling events.
The frontend part was already developed.
You have to implement the database and the required APIs.

## Install and run

Create a new environment with virtualenv or conda. Activate it, then install the requirements using:
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the application with:
```shell
fastapi dev
```

You can also run the `main.py` file as a script.

## Database
The system have a DB with 3 tables for storing events, users and user registrations to events.
The latter is already implemented.

An event must be uniquely identified by its ID, that have to be automatically assigned by the system.
A user must be uniquely identified by its username, that have to be automatically assigned by the system.

The code to initialize the DB and create the tables is already implemented.
Don't forget to import the classes associated with the tables in `data/db.py`, otherwise the net tables won't be created!

For the `date` attribute of the events table, you can use the datetime type:
```python
from datetime import datetime
```

## APIs
